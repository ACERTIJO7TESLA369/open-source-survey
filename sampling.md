# Sampling

The goal of this survey is to create a dataset of and for the open source community. This document outlines our approach to sampling survey respondents both on, and off GitHub.com.

Quoting from the [design principles document](https://github.com/github/open-source-survey/blob/master/design-principles.md):

> The universe of this study is anyone who uses or otherwise engages with open source technology and development, whether passively or actively through contributions. This is a broader definition of this community than commonly employed, and we believe one of the major contributions of this study will be a dataset that allows for exploration of open source consumers alongside contributors.

In other words, we want to sample as many different open source communities as possible.

## Sampling on GitHub

Broadly the plan is to sample a randomly selected set of visitors (either logged in or logged out) to licensed open source repositories. They will be presented with some kind of dialog inviting them to complete the survey.

TODO: We will post more details here once this has been implemented.

## Sampling off GitHub

[community-application]: https://goo.gl/forms/c9iU2jgbnHXaaKBt1

We are inviting as many open source communities as possible to participate. If you would like your community to participate in the survey, please [fill out this form][community-application]. When the survey launches, we will send you a template email that includes a custom survey URL for you to share with your community. While the survey is running, we’ll provide you with periodic updates (via email) to let you know what the response rate of your community has been so far.

If you have any questions or feedback please either open an issue on this repository or email us on opensource@github.com if you’d like to keep things private.
