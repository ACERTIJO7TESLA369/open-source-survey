## Types of contributions we're looking for

We're still putting the finishing touches on the survey instrument and aren't quite ready to start collecting survey responses. [Sign up for updates](http://opensourcesurvey.org) if you'd like to be notified when the survey is available.

Right now we're looking for your help in two main areas:

0. If you're a researcher who's studied topics similar to the ones [we're interested in](./survey-topics.md), we'd love to hear from you about any existing survey instruments that explore these topic areas. There's [an issue](https://github.com/github/the-open-source-survey/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) in this repository for each topic area - please let us know about existing work there.

0. If you're active in an open source community that doesn't use GitHub as their primary platform for collaboration we'd love to hear from you. We want to reach _all_ open source communities with this survey and so if you think you might be able to help us reach our to your community email opensource@github.com

0. If you believe this survey should be investigating additional and/or alternative topics then feel free to suggest them in [the survey repository](https://github.com/github/the-open-source-survey/issues/new?title=I%27d%20like%20to%20suggest%20a%20survey%20topic). We can't promise that we'll include your suggestion in this iteration of the survey (or any future one) but if you can make a strong case for the inclusion of a new topic we'd love to hear your suggestions.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "what is important for open source." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* This survey is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/github/the-open-source-survey/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/github/the-open-source-survey/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this survey, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, you can make the change and open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new article or case study, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.
