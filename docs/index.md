This November, we plan to run the biggest survey of the Free and Open Source community to date, the results of which will be an open dataset for the community to use and learn from.

## _We need your help_

Sign up [here](http://example.com) to let us know you want to take part.

## Why are we doing this

Like many of you, we ❤️ Open Source and we want to make it even better. This survey is an opportunity for you, the open source community, to tell us a little more about yourselves, the things you care about, and what's good (and bad) about open source.

## Open data

We think it's important that all communities get to learn from the results of this survey, that's why the results of this survey will be a public dataset for the community to use. Lean more about the survey design in the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/github/foss-survey).

## Partners
